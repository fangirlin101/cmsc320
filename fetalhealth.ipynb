    "Through this project, we are aiming to use fetal health data to understand and classify the health of a fetus as Normal, Suspect or Pathological We are doing this using CTG (Cardiotocogram) data.\n",
    "Classificaton of fetal health into these three criteria is of utmost importance as this helps reduce child and maternal mortality. As per The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, reduction of child mortality is a key indicator of human progress. \n",
    "The SDGs seek massive reductions in mortality ralte, and aim to have a a neonatal mortality rate of 12 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births, and an under-five mortality rate of 25 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births, by 2030. However, more than 5 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2020. \n",
    "In a similar light, in lower-income and lower-resource areas, there is still a shocking number of deaths of the mother during, before, and after childbirth due to complications which could be preventable with some fetal moniroting and care. This leads to very high maternal mortality rate, but more importantly the preventable loss of countless lives. \n",
    "We aim to try and build a model to move closer to this important goal of reducing child and maternal mortality through classification of CTG data. CTG are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n",
